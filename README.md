# A C++ open-source CoAP implementation

## Introduction
lib-coap-cpp is an open-source implementation of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).
This is a library which can be linked with your source code. 
This implementation also includes some examples of a server and a client.
It uses the library WolfSSL to provide a secure DTLS connection. The C++ 11 standard is used in a greater part of this library, specialy the server side. 

## Requirements
To build the library lib-coap-cpp you shall use CMake version at least 3.5 and GNU Make version 4.1 or newer.
g++ is used as a C++ compiler. It shall be at least version  7.4.0.
Docker container technology can be used to build the library and examples, as well as to isolate the CoAP server written in C++.
